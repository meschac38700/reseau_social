-   To prepare the development environment, you have to:
        
        -   Launch database.sh file.
            That file going to create a database and a SQL 'users' table.
            The script going to ask you if you want to change the database's name otherwise the default name is 'reseauSocial'

        -   Create a new database.php file in the config folder
        -   take inspiration from the contents of database.example.php to configure your database.

-   To start the server

    -   execute server.sh script file
